# Cypress API Testing Framework
## Explanation
In this small project, I used Cypress as an automation tool and JavaScript as a programming language. This framework shows basics for TDD and CRUD operations.

I performed my tests on PetStore API and in its Users folder.

### Tech Stack
- node.js: v18.17.1
- npm: 10.1.0
- cypress: 13.3.0
- cypress-plugin-api: v1

**Base URL :** petstore.swagger.io/v2 \
**Swagger Document :** https://petstore.swagger.io/

### Running Tests
1. If you wanna see UI of Cypress, type `npx cypress open` on the Terminal
2. You can also run tests without a UI by typing `npm run test`

### Reports
I used cypress-mochawesome-reporter plugin to create my reports. You can see it in `cypress\reports\html\index.html`
